# Anti-CyberBullying-API-v2

**Created an API used to detect and avoid abusive contents/comments/posts on various social media and chatting platforms.**

* Built a LSTM and RNN model for text classification as abusive or non-abusive.
* Used Pickle to dump the trained model which helps in avoiding the model to be trained for everytime for a query request.
* Used Flask to create the API for trained model and launched it using Heroku web hosting service.
* Created a simple web-page as UI for testing and making queries to the API. 
* Built a simple chat app using Android Studio and Firebase Realtime Database to demonstrate the application and use of our API.
